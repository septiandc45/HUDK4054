## Abstract

```
Bullying has become a serious issue around the world, including in Indonesia. This study
aims to examine the impacts of three types of bullying experiences (physical, verbal, and
indirect) on three domains of students’ well-being (physical, psychological, and social) and how
they differ across the gender and education levels of Indonesian students. Using the
mixed-method research design, this study targets 44355 students representing the country’s
populations for the quantitative approach and 8 students and 4 school counselors from 4 different
education levels for the qualitative approach. Using illustrative data to demonstrate the findings,
the quantitative results showed that males are more prone to experience all types of bullying
compared with females. On the contrary, the qualitative findings revealed that males are
vulnerable to experiencing physical bullying but females are more likely to experience verbal
and indirect bullying. In addition, the quantitative showed there were no significant main effects
of all types of bullying on physical well-being but verbal and indirect bullying were found to
have negative relationships on students’ psychological and social well-being. However, the
qualitative tells an in-depth narrative of the negative impacts of each type of bullying on
students’ physical, psychological, and social well-being. There were some significant
interactions between bullying types and genders or education levels on students' well-being. It
means that the effects of bullying on well-being were not the same across gender or education
levels. Finally, the qualitative approach showed that males and females are not different in using
a coping mechanism to deal with bullying. The qualitative data did not provide sufficient
information to infer the bullying prevalence and students' coping strategies across different
education levels.

## Research Questions
1. What are the main effects of each type of bullying on each domain of students’ well-being?
2. How do students describe their physical health, and psychological and social experience following incidents of bullying?
3. What is the prevalence of bullying among students at different gender and education levels?
4. To what extent do the effects of bullying on students’ well-being vary across gender and education levels?
5. What coping mechanisms do male and female students use to deal with bullying, and how do these strategies differ at various education levels? 

## Research Design  
This project will use **a mixed-method research design** which combines quantitative and qualitative approaches.  
1. **Quantitative approach**: Cross Sectional study

| **Total**               |                   **44376914** |                 **44355** |                  **1253** |

Targetted samples for qualitative data collection is approximately **8 students** and **4 counselors** from **4 schools** in **3 regions** with **equal combinations of urban, rural, public, and private schools**.

## Variables and Data Collection Tools

Variables:
- **Dependent Variables (DV)**: Physical Well-Being, Psychological Well-Being, and Social Well-Being
- **Independent Variables (IV)**: Physical Bullying, V erbal Bullying, Indirect Bullying, Gender, and Education
Level

Data Collection Tools:
- **Quantitative Instrument**: PISA 2018 questionnaire (OECD, 2018b)

## Research Data

**DISCLAIMER!!!** For demonstrative purposes, this proposal used synthetic data to illustrate the results of the study. It combined original data from PISA 2018 database (OECD, 2018a) and fabricated data by AI for variable Physical Well-Being and Education Level. Please be advised that the results produced by this dataset may not reflect the final results. This section will be updated after the real data is collected and ready to be published.

# REFLECTION

## 1. Which metadata standard did you choose and why?

I chose DDI (Data Documentation Initiative) as the metadata standard for my research project because it is specifically designed for documenting data in the behavioral sciences which is relevant to my field that aims to investigate the impact of bullying on students’ well-being across education levels and gender.

## 2. Which template/software did you use?

I used github to write this readme file.

## 3. What was the most challenging part of creating a ReadME file? How did you overcome these obstacles?

All parts of this assignment were very challenging for me. The details are as follows:
1. **Challenge in selecting the content**: As mentioned in reference videos, the first challenge I faced was determining which information I'd like to include in this file. I noticed that it should be informative but not too long. I overcame this challenge by reflecting and asking myself what I hope to be presented on that file if I read someone else's file. I also looked at the example file you gave to help me decide which sections that are relevant to my project.
2. **Technical challenges in writing the codes**: This is my first time writing a document using Markdown as well as using Git Hub. I found that coding is very challenging but also intuitive. At first, I was confused how to start. I could not even write headings and subheadings. To overcome these challenges, I asked ChatGPT for some specific questions such as how to bold the text and I learned that I have to use the double asterisk (**) to do that. The overall process was time-consuming because I learned everything from scratch but the final product was quite rewarding for me.
