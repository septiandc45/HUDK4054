## Abstract

```
Bullying has become a serious issue around the world, including in Indonesia. This study
aims to examine the impacts of three types of bullying experiences (physical, verbal, and
indirect) on three domains of students’ well-being (physical, psychological, and social) and how
they differ across the gender and education levels of Indonesian students. Using the
mixed-method research design, this study targets 44355 students representing the country’s
populations for the quantitative approach and 8 students and 4 school counselors from 4 different
education levels for the qualitative approach. Using illustrative data to demonstrate the findings,
the quantitative results showed that males are more prone to experience all types of bullying
compared with females. On the contrary, the qualitative findings revealed that males are
vulnerable to experiencing physical bullying but females are more likely to experience verbal
and indirect bullying. In addition, the quantitative showed there were no significant main effects
of all types of bullying on physical well-being but verbal and indirect bullying were found to
have negative relationships on students’ psychological and social well-being. However, the
qualitative tells an in-depth narrative of the negative impacts of each type of bullying on
students’ physical, psychological, and social well-being. There were some significant
interactions between bullying types and genders or education levels on students' well-being. It
means that the effects of bullying on well-being were not the same across gender or education
levels. Finally, the qualitative approach showed that males and females are not different in using
a coping mechanism to deal with bullying. The qualitative data did not provide sufficient
information to infer the bullying prevalence and students' coping strategies across different
education levels.

## Research Questions
1. What are the main effects of each type of bullying on each domain of students’ well-being?
2. How do students describe their physical health, and psychological and social experience following incidents of bullying?
3. What is the prevalence of bullying among students at different gender and education levels?
4. To what extent do the effects of bullying on students’ well-being vary across gender and education levels?
5. What coping mechanisms do male and female students use to deal with bullying, and how do these strategies differ at various education levels?
